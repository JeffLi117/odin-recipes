            <h3><div class="h3">Description</div></h3>
            <p>Delicious, chewy chocolate cookies that taste like brownies. Made by Lois Wells, this recipe is intended to give the baker (and all invested parties partaking in taste testing!) the joys of both cookies and brownies.</p>

            <h3><div class="h1">Ingredients</div></h3>
                <ul class="ingred">
                    <li>2 cups white sugar</li>
                    <li>1¼ cups margarine, softened</li>
                    <li>2 eggs</li>
                    <li>2 teaspoons vanilla extract</li>
                    <li>2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
                    <li>¾ cup unsweetened cocoa powder</li>
                    <li>1 teaspoon baking soda</li>
                    <li>⅛ teaspoon salt</li>
                    <li>1 cup chopped walnuts</li>
                </ul>
            <h3>Steps</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
                    <li>Cream sugar and margarine in a large bowl until light and fluffy. Beat in eggs, one at a time, then stir in vanilla.</li>
                    <li>Combine flour, cocoa, baking soda, and salt in a separate bowl. Add to the creamed mixture and mix until just blended. Stir in walnuts. Drop by spoonfuls onto ungreased cookie sheets.</li>
                    <li>Bake in the preheated oven until edges are set and centers are soft, 8 to 10 minutes. Let sit briefly before transferring to wire racks to cool completely.</li>
